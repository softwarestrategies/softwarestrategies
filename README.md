My name is Henry Dall and Software Strategies is my consulting/contracting entity.

Experienced at driving successful solutions to complex software problems in diverse business domains. Well-versed in current technologies & best practices and am a quick study, good communicator & curious learner and have had to have a good sense of humor.

Please excuse the ramshackle state of my Github page.  It's next on my todo list.
